# SimpleFast

Welcome to the official repository of **SimpleFast** - an innovative programming language designed to provide simplicity and readability of Python with the performance of C++. It's designed to be user-friendly and approachable for beginners, while also providing the features and performance that advanced users and data scientists need.

## About SimpleFast

SimpleFast is a statically-typed, compiled language that leverages a C++ backend for superior runtime performance. It employs a minimalistic, English-like syntax to make code easy to write and understand.

One of the primary goals of SimpleFast is to make programming more accessible and less daunting for beginners. The syntax is designed to be as intuitive as possible, reducing the cognitive load for new programmers.

At the same time, SimpleFast is designed to be powerful and flexible enough for professional use. The language includes support for advanced features like object-oriented programming, interfaces, and asynchronous I/O.

## Features

- **Simplicity**: SimpleFast's syntax is clean and intuitive, making it easy to learn and use.
- **Performance**: With a C++ backend, SimpleFast offers performance close to that of lower-level languages.
- **Static Typing**: SimpleFast is statically typed which helps catch errors at compile time.
- **Object-Oriented**: SimpleFast supports classes and interfaces, making it suitable for large, complex projects.
- **Asynchronous I/O**: SimpleFast includes built-in support for asynchronous I/O operations, making it great for web and network programming.

## File Extension and Compiler

- SimpleFast source files use the `.sfast` file extension.
- The SimpleFast compiler, `sfastc`, compiles `.sfast` files into executable binaries.
